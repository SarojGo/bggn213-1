# BGGN213 

This is my classwork from BGGN213 at UC San Diego (S18). 
The main class homepage is [here](https://bioboot.github.io/bggn213_S18/)

- **Class05**: [Data Visualization in R](https://bioboot.github.io/bggn213/class05/class5.html) (for other formats see  [.MD](https://github.com/bioboot/bggn213/blob/master/class05/class5.md) and [.R](https://github.com/bioboot/bggn213/blob/master/class05/class5.R)).


- Class06: [Why, when and how of writing your own R functions]() 

- Class07: [Bioinformatics R packages from CRAN and BioConductor]() 

- **Class08**: [Machine Learning for Bioinformatics 1]() 

- **Class09**: [Machine learning project](https://bioboot.github.io/bggn213/class09/class9.html)

- Etc.

> **Side-Note:** Fix for Rmd to md date: format is simply to rm these lines. First make sure you have "Pulled" your Repo down from GitHub and are in your updated GitHub tracked dir at the Terminal ;-)

```
# Remove all lines with 'date:' in them and a leave backup
sed -i.bk '/date:/d'  class*/*.md
```
