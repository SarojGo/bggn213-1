# BGGN213 

This is my classwork from BGGN213 at UC San Diego (S18). 
The main class homepage is [here](https://bioboot.github.io/bggn213_S18/)

- **Class05**: [Data Visualization in R](class05/class5/) for other self contained formats see [HTML](https://bioboot.github.io/bggn213/class05/class5.html), [MD](https://github.com/bioboot/bggn213/blob/master/class05/class5.md) and [R](https://github.com/bioboot/bggn213/blob/master/class05/class5.R).
- Class06: [Why, when and how of writing your own R functions]() 
- Class07: [Bioinformatics R packages from CRAN and BioConductor]() 
- **Class08**: [Machine Learning for Bioinformatics 1]() 
- **Class09**: [Machine learning project](class09/class9/)
- Etc.


> **Side-Note:** Fix for Rmd to md date: format is simply to rm these lines

```
# Make sure you have "Pulled" your Repo down from GitHub
# And are in your updated GitHub tracked dir ;-)
sed -i.bk '/date:/d'  class*/*.md
```
